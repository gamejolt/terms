#### Game Jolt Creator Platform Agreement

This is a binding agreement between Game Jolt Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Us" or "Game Jolt"), and you, the Game Jolt platform Account holder that accepts this Agreement ("You" or "Creator").

Please read this whole agreement, as it contains the terms of your relationship with Game Jolt and your use of the Game Jolt platform and its platform for creators to better engage with their audience and earn rewards.

By agreeing to this, you're also agreeing to our [Terms of Service](http://gamejolt.com/terms) and [Privacy Policy](http://gamejolt.com/privacy), which are incorporated into this agreement.

If you check the box at the bottom and click the button marked "I Agree," you are making a legally-binding promise that you've read the agreement and that you'll be bound by these terms. If you don't agree, please don't use the Game Jolt Creator Features and don't click the button.

##### 1. Definitions

First, we need to define some of the important terms in this agreement.

**"Account"** means your account on the Game Jolt Platform, through which you can post your games and other content, engage in daily quests and other platform activities, access your payment information, cash out any payments received, and other Game Jolt or Creator Platform-related things.

**"Creator Platform"** means all Creator-specific functionality accessible by a Creator through their Account on the Game Jolt Platform, including the ability for Creators to provide updates to user followers, engage with their followers through quests, earn rewards, and cash out those rewards.

**"Content"** means all Creator-posted content on the Game Jolt Platform, including but not limited to games, music, and artwork, plus any upgrades or add-ons, which a Creator's user followers can view and interact with as part of the Creator Platform.

**"Creator Revenue"** means revenue earned by a Creator through the Creator Platform, as further described in Section 4 below.

**"Game Jolt Platform"** means the Game Jolt website (located at gamejolt.com), software clients and mobile apps, and other related websites and software applications.

**"Users"** are any users of the Game Jolt Platform.

##### 2. Our License to You

2.1. **License for you to use the Creator Platform.** When you sign up for an Account as a Creator, we grant you a non-exclusive and non-transferable license to use the Creator Platform for the purposes of this Agreement. However, this license is conditioned on you following any Creator guidelines published by us and made available to you on the Game Jolt website, and the Game Jolt Terms of Use.

2.2. **Creator Platform Information.** You will be able to see more specifics about the Creator Platform on the Game Jolt Platform, including in your Account and in any information Game Jolt provides to you. These specifics will include things like the types of activities that can earn you Creator Revenue, the types of quests and virtual items available to Creators and Users to engage with the Creator Platform, and more. The Creator Platform is ever-evolving as features are added and removed based on Creator and User feedback, so please check in with the Game Jolt Platform for more information regularly.

##### 3. Payments

3.1. **Payment Terms.** Once a Creator has reached a certain level of engagement with their followers on the Creator Platform, that Creator will earn an amount of Creator Revenue to be determined by Game Jolt, at their sole discretion. Game Jolt may modify the actual amount of Creator Revenue earned at any time, in its sole discretion and with no obligation to Creators as a result of such modification.

All payments of Creator Revenue to Creator will be in US Dollars, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by you and Game Jolt.

3.2. **Payment Processing.** Game Jolt uses different third-party payment processing services to enable any withdrawal of Creator Revenue on the Game Jolt Platform. If Game Jolt uses PayPal to transfer your Creator Revenue, that withdrawal request and transfer will require you to have a PayPal account and to provide that information to Game Jolt prior to any withdrawal, and to agree to PayPal's Terms of Use, Privacy Policy, and other service agreements. If Game Jolt uses Stripe Connect to process payments, you must agree to Stripe's [Stripe Connect Account Agreement](https://stripe.com/us/connect-account/legal), which is incorporated into this agreement by reference, including their collection and use of Personal Information, as detailed in both [Game Jolt's](http://gamejolt.com/privacy) and [Stripe's](https://stripe.com/us/privacy) Privacy Policies.

3.3. **Your Wallet.** Your Creator Revenue is kept in your Game Jolt Wallet. Creator Revenue will be made available in your Wallet at regular intervals (monthly, for example) at Game Jolt's discretion, based on the prior period's Creator activity and engagement on the Creator Platform.

3.4. **Connected Withdrawal Methods.** You may set up a payment method (such as a PayPal account) offered as an option by Game Jolt that you connect to your Account (your "Connected Withdrawal Method") in your Account dashboard. Game Jolt will automatically transfer your Creator Revenue regularly to your Connected Withdrawal Method, as further described in Section 3.6 below. However, Game Jolt **does not** have a way to redirect incorrectly-transferred Creator Revenue once they have left your Wallet. Game Jolt is **not responsible** for any errors on your part in entering information about your Connected Withdrawal Method or otherwise that results in the loss of Creator Revenue in your Wallet.

3.5. **Negative Amounts.** If any payment calculation results in a negative amount, that negative amount will be carried forward and deducted from any future amounts otherwise payable by Game Jolt to you under this agreement or any other agreement between us.

3.6. **Revenue Withdrawal.** Your Creator Revenue will be automatically transferred to your Connected Withdrawal Method monthly, as long as the total amount of Creator Revenue in your account is over USD $20. Again, Game Jolt is not responsible if you don't input your Connected Withdrawal Information correctly or otherwise make an error that results in the loss of your Creator Revenue (this is important, so we're stating it again!).

3.7. **Tax Forms.** If you live in the United States and earn at least $600 in a calendar year, we will send you a 1099 form to the address you include in your Account.

3.8. **Survival of Payment Obligations.** Any payment obligations of Game Jolt will survive if this agreement is terminated. However, Game Jolt has no liability to make any payments if the payment information in your Account is not accurate, if the Account or any aspect of the Account is fraudulent, or if the Account or the Creator is in violation of this agreement or the Game Jolt Terms of Service in any way.

##### 4. Your Promises

4.1. You promise to provide accurate information, including information about your Connected Withdrawal Method, in your Account Dashboard.

4.2. You promise that your conduct on the Game Jolt Platform will at all times be in accordance with this Agreement, the Game Jolt Terms of Use, and any other Game Jolt Platform agreements.

4.3. You promise to act in accordance with any applicable laws and regulations when using the Creator Platform.

##### 5. Confidentiality

5.1 You promise to keep any confidential information that has not yet been made public, which is communicated to you under this agreement, confidential.

Confidential information can include (but isn't limited to) any of the following: amount of Creator Revenue earned and how any Creator Revenue is calculated, non-public communications between you and Game Jolt (whether through chat, email, or other non-public communications methods) regarding the Creator Program, information relating to released or unreleased products or Creator Platform features (including any non-public product and feature roadmaps), taxpayer identification numbers, residential addresses, bank account information and payment processing information that either you or Game Jolt are obligated to treat as confidential.

##### 6. Termination

6.1. You may terminate your Account at any time by contacting us at [contact@gamejolt.com](mailto:contact@gamejolt.com).

6.2. We may terminate your Account at any time, and for any reason, at our sole discretion.

##### 7. Warranties and Liability

7.1. **No Warranties.** The Creator Platform and all of Game Jolt's services are provided on an "as is," "as available" basis, as modified from time to time by us. There is no warranty of any kind.

Game Jolt disclaims any and all warranties, either express or implied, including (without limitation) implied warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quiet enjoyment, quality of information, title, and non-infringement. Game Jolt also disclaims any warranty regarding the amount of Creator Revenue that may be earned, and about the non-interruption of use, freedom from bugs, and that use of the Creator Platform or any Game Jolt service will be error-free.

You acknowledge and agree that your use of the Creator Platform or any Game Jolt service is at your own risk. No information or advice given either orally or in writing by Game Jolt or its affiliates will create a warranty or in any way increase the scope of Game Jolt's obligations to you under this agreement.

Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, the foregoing disclaimer will only apply to the maximum extent allowed by applicable law.

7.2. **Limitation of Liability.** To the maximum extent permissible by law, Game Jolt and its affiliates have no liability to you or any other person for any loss of profits, sales, business, data, or other incidental, consequential, or special loss or damage of any kind. This includes, without limitation, exemplary and punitive damages, arising out of this agreement or your use of the Creator Platform or any Game Jolt service.

The total liability of Game Jolt and its affiliates to you or any third party arising out of this agreement will be limited to the amount of Creator Revenue that you earned in the two months before the event giving rise to the liability. This limitation of liability will apply even if the express warranties in this agreement fail in their essential purpose.

Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or the limitation of liability for certain types of damages, in those states or jurisdictions the liability of Game Jolt and its affiliates is limited to the fullest extent permitted by law.

##### 8. The Legal Stuff (Don't Stop Reading)

8.1. **Assignment.** You can't assign this agreement to another party without our written consent.

8.2. **Indemnity.** You will indemnify, defend and hold harmless Game Jolt and its directors, officers, managers, employees and agents from and against any and all losses, liabilities, expenses, judgments, settlements reasonably approved by the indemnified party, costs, or damages (including reasonable attorneys' fees) resulting from claims asserted by third parties arising out of or in connection with this agreement, to the extent that they were caused by the actual or alleged breach (by act or omission) of your representations, warranties or obligations under this agreement. The obligations under this section will survive the termination of this agreement

8.3. **Governing Law.** This agreement is governed by Washington state law, and any disputes will be held in the courts located in Seattle, Washington, USA.

8.4. **Arbitration.** Any claim arising out of this agreement or the dealings of you and Game Jolt will be settled by arbitration.

Whichever party prevails in the arbitration will be entitled to attorneys' fees, travel expenses, and any other expenses awarded at the arbitrator's discretion. The arbitration will take place in Seattle, Washington, but either party may participate through virtual or telephone appearances.

8.5. **Class Action Waiver.** You and Game Jolt agree that any arbitration and any other litigation must be limited to the claim between you and Game Jolt individually. This means that neither of us have the right to arbitrate or litigate any dispute on a class action basis, or use class action procedures. Neither of us can bring a dispute as a private attorney general. Neither of us is allowed to join any arbitration or litigation with any other arbitration or litigation.

8.6. **No Partnership.** You and Game Jolt are not partners, joint venturers, a single business entity, or any other type of partnership. You are not Game Jolt's agent, and are not authorized to act as Game Jolt's agent.

8.7. **Entire Agreement.** This agreement is the entire agreement of you and Game Jolt. This agreement can't be modified by you, except by a written amendment signed by both of us. We can modify this agreement by sending you notice of the changes to the email address on your Account.
