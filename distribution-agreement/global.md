First, we need to define some of the important terms in this agreement.

"**Revenue**" means any Ad Revenue and/or Product Revenue combined.

"**Users**" are any parties that purchase Products through the Marketplace or use the Marketplace in any way.

##### 2. Your Rights and Ours

2.1. **License to display your Products.** By offering a Product for purchase or download on the Marketplace through your Account, you grant Game Jolt a non-exclusive, worldwide license in perpetuity, in any type of media (including those not yet invented), to do the following:

2.1.1. Display your Product to anyone, anywhere on the Marketplace;

2.1.2. Use any Product names, screenshots, trailers, logos, or any other assets ("Product Assets") in connection with the Marketplace, in any Game Jolt advertisement and promotion (including, but not limited to, conventions and trade shows), and any other place reasonably necessary to promote Game Jolt, the Marketplace, and any Products;

2.1.3. Edit or modify any Product Assets in order to create trailers, advertisements, or promotions for Game Jolt, the Marketplace, and any Products.

2.2. **License to offer your Products for sale.** By offering a Product for purchase or download on the Marketplace through your Account, you also grant Game Jolt a non-exclusive, worldwide license to sell, reproduce, and distribute your Product to Users. Should the Product cease to be offered for purchase of download at any time, you agree that Game Jolt retains the ability, worldwide and in perpetuity, to fulfill any sale, deliver any Product, and make available for download any Product sold to Users up to the point that the Product ceased to be offered.

2.3. **License for you to use the Marketplace.** When you sign up for an Account, we grant you a non-exclusive and non-transferable license to use the Marketplace for the purposes of offering Products for purchase or download, including displaying the Game Jolt sales widget on any website. We also grant you a license to use the Game Jolt logo in connection with the advertising, promotion, and sale of your Products, on your website, social media, or wherever you're using the sales widget. However, these licenses are conditioned on you following any Marketplace guidelines published by us and made available to you on the Game Jolt website.

2.4. **Ownership - who owns what?**

2.4.1. **Your Products.** You own the rights to your Products, subject to the licenses you granted to us above.

2.4.2. **Your sales data.** You own any sales data related to your Products, but you grant us a license to use that sales data to calculate payments, fulfill User purchases, improve the Marketplace, and any other reasonable use in a masked aggregate basis. If your Account is terminated, we'll try to keep your sales data around long enough for you to download it, but we don't promise that we'll keep it available for more than 10 days. However, if your Account or your use of the Marketplace is in violation of this agreement or our Terms of Service, we do not guarantee that we can make any sales data available to you at all.

2.4.3. **The Marketplace.** We own all rights to the Marketplace, subject to the licenses that we granted to you above and any open source licenses that we release portions of the Marketplace under.

2.4.4. **Game Jolt content.** We own the rights to any Game Jolt content, logos, trademarks, copyrights, and other intellectual property.

2.4.5. **Suggestions and Feedback.** From time to time, you may provide suggestions, feedback, or make requests of Game Jolt related to the Marketplace or any other aspect of Game Jolt. You hereby assign to Game Jolt all rights to any request, suggestion or feedback regarding the functionality, performance, and potential errors or improvements to the Marketplace, and Game Jolt will have the right to use, implement and modify any such request, suggestion or feedback without any payment or restriction.

##### 3. Responsibilities

3.1. **Our responsibilities.** When you submit a Product for sale or download (or any upgrade, patch, or add-on for a Product) through the Marketplace, we will make reasonable efforts to make that Product displayed, available for sale or download, and distributed through the Marketplace either on a date that you choose, or as soon as we can after you submit the Product. We will make commercially reasonable efforts to implement the Marketplace, and to provide User support for the Marketplace, process User sales and downloads, and process payments to you in a timely manner.

3.2. **Your responsibilities.** You are responsible for providing technical support to Users for any Product that you sell or offer for download through the Marketplace, for delivering to us a master compiled code version of any Product or Product upgrades, patches, or add-ons (as applicable), and for performing industry-standard quality assurance, error testing, and bug fixing of the Product before you offer them for sale or download on the Marketplace. If you don't provide adequate QA testing, we reserve the right to remove the Product from the Marketplace and terminate this agreement and/or your Account.

##### 4. Product Pricing Options

The Marketplace offers you three options for monetizing your Product. You can set or change these in your Account dashboard.

4.1. **Fixed Price.** You choose a fixed price that Users pay for your Product.

4.2. **Name-Your-Price.** Users can choose a price, or pay nothing at all for your Product.

4.3. **Free with Advertisements.** You offer your Product for Users to download for free, but the Product is monetized by advertisements displayed on your Product page. There is more information about Ads below in the section titled "Product Ad Revenue." You may choose to disable advertisement monetization of free Products on your Account Dashboard.

##### 5. Payments

5.1. **Payment Terms.** When you offer a Product for sale or download on the Marketplace, you may choose to either run advertisements on your Product page, or charge a purchase price for your Product. You can't do both, even for so-called "Freemium" games. If you're charging money (4.1) or giving the User the option to pay (4.2), you can't have ads.

If you are charging money (4.1 and 4.2), you set the percentage of the purchase price that goes to Game Jolt in your Account Dashboard, but you can only give us up to 10% of the purchase price.

If you choose to offer your Product for download with advertisements (4.3), you will receive a percentage of revenue that comes from advertisements on your Product page. See the definition of "Ad Revenue" in Section 1 above.

All payments will be in US Dollars, unless otherwise agreed upon in writing by you and Game Jolt.

5.2. **Stripe.** Game Jolt uses Stripe Connect to process payments, for fraud prevention, and other services related to the Marketplace. By using the Marketplace, you agree to Stripe's [Stripe Connect Account Agreement](https://stripe.com/us/connect-account/legal), which is incorporated into this agreement by reference, including their collection and use of Personal Information, as detailed in both [Game Jolt's](http://gamejolt.com/privacy) and [Stripe's](https://stripe.com/us/privacy) Privacy Policies.

5.3. **Refunds.** Users may request a refund within 3 days of their purchase of a Product. As a general policy, Game Jolt will only grant refunds to Users if the Product does not actually start or fails to work because the Product is broken or non-functional, but we reserve the right to grant refunds for any reason. For more information, see our [Terms of Service](http://gamejolt.com/terms).

5.4. **Your Wallet.** Your Revenue is kept in your Game Jolt Wallet. Funds in your Wallet will be made available approximately 7 days after each order is placed by a User and processed, to allow for any refunds, chargebacks, or fraudulent payments. You can either withdraw this money from your Wallet directly to your bank account, PayPal account, or other method of withdrawal offered as an option by Game Jolt that you connect with your Account (the "Connected Withdrawal Method"), or use it to purchase Products on the Marketplace.

5.5. **Connected Withdrawal Methods.** You may set up a Connected Withdrawal Method in your Account dashboard. However, Game Jolt **does not** have a way to redirect incorrectly-transferred funds once they have left your Wallet. Game Jolt is **not responsible** for any errors on your part in entering information about your Connected Withdrawal Method or otherwise that results in the loss of Wallet funds.

5.6. **Purchases using Wallet Funds.** If you use funds from your Wallet to purchase Products that are not your own, none of the purchase price goes to Game Jolt - the entirety of the purchase price goes to the seller of that Product.

5.7. **Negative Amounts.** If any payment calculation results in a negative amount, that negative amount will be carried forward and deducted from any future amounts otherwise payable by Game Jolt to you under this agreement or any other agreement between us.

5.8. **Funds Withdrawal.** You can request to withdraw Revenue in your Wallet at any time, provided that the amount is over $.05. Game Jolt will make reasonable efforts to process such withdrawal requests nightly, but you agree and acknowledge that there may be delays. You can set a maximum amount of Revenue to be held in your Wallet, and any amount above that maximum will be transferred to your Connected Withdrawal Method at the end of each month. You can also set a minimum withdrawal amount, and when the Revenue in your Wallet is greater than your Wallet maximum plus your minimum withdrawal amount, the remaining funds will be automatically transferred to your Connected Withdrawal Method.

You can set up your Connected Withdrawal Method, along with these maximums and minimums, in your Account dashboard.

5.9. **Tax Forms.** If you live in the United States and earn at least $600 in a calendar year, we will send you a 1099 form to the address you include in your Account.

5.10. **Survival of Payment Obligations.** Any payment obligations of Game Jolt will survive if this agreement is terminated. However, Game Jolt has no liability to make any payments if the payment information in your Account is not accurate, if the Account or any aspect of the Account is fraudulent, if the Products infringe on the intellectual property or rights of Game Jolt or any third party, of if the Account or the Product is in violation of this agreement or the Game Jolt Terms of Service in any way.

##### 6. Product Ad Revenue

6.1. **Advertisements.** If you choose to monetize your Products using advertisements, Game Jolt will place advertisements using Google AdSense and/or other ad networks (at Game Jolt's sole discretion) on your Product page. You agree to abide by Google's policies, including their [policy on adult content, or the comparable policies of the applicable ad network](https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/4410771?hl=en-GB). If your Product is in violation of any laws, including intellectual property laws, or in violation of our [Terms of Service](http://gamejolt.com/terms) in **any** way, we may disallow ads on your Product page, withhold Ad Revenue, and/or terminate your Account and this agreement. Just to be clear, Game Jolt has **sole discretion** over whether or not ads can run on your Product pages.

##### 7. Game Jolt Partner Program

7.1. **The Program.** The Partner Program allows Partners to download your Products and create or stream videos of Product gameplay ("Partner Content"). Partners will be provided with unique URLs to Products opted into the Partner Program ("Partner Links"). When a User clicks on a Partner Link, they will be brought to your Product page. If they purchase the Product, the Partner will receive a portion of Revenue.

7.2. **Opt In.** You must opt in for each individual Product, in order for those Products to be included in the Partner Program. Once opted in, the Product will be displayed on a list of Products available to Partners. You agree that Partners may download opted-in Products free of charge. No Revenue will be paid to you for these downloads by Partners. Downloads of the Products by Partners as part of the Partner Program are licenses, which may be revoked by Game Jolt at their sole discretion, and no ownership is transferred.

7.3. **Opt Out.** Once a Product is opted into the Partner Program, you may then choose to opt out. However, any Partner Links created prior to opting out will remain active subject to this agreement, the Partner Program agreement, the Terms of Use and Privacy Policy.

7.4. **Revenue Share.** Product Revenue generated from a User arriving on the Service through a Partner Link will be shared between you and the Partner, with the Partner receiving 10% of the Revenue. This Revenue share is subject to change at Game Jolt's sole discretion. The Partner's share of Revenue is in addition to Game Jolt's share, as allocated by you in your Account Dashboard.

7.5. **No Guarantees.** Opting into the Partner Program does not guarantee that Partners will download or play your Product, create videos of your Product, or display Partner Links to your Product, or that your Products will be sold once a User clicks on a Partner Link to your Product.

7.6. **Disputes.** Disputes between you and a Partner regarding the Partner Content and their use and advertisement of the Products must be resolved between you and the Partner. You acknowledge and agree that Game Jolt is not a party to such a dispute, nor is Game Jolt responsible for the outcome of any such dispute.

7.7. **Other Terms.** By opting into the Partner Program, you agree to the following terms:

7.7.1. Neither you nor Game Jolt have any ownership or control, editorial or otherwise, of the Partner Content, including any comments by the Partner or the positive or negative viewpoint of the Partner toward the Product;

7.7.2. Your Product will conform with the Game Jolt Terms of Use and Privacy Policy, and any other Game Jolt policies;

7.7.3. Game Jolt will not reveal any non-public information about any Partner in the Partner Program to you, including names, addresses, and other contact information;

7.7.5. Game Jolt and Partners in the Partner Program are not partners, joint venturers, a single business entity, or any other type of partnership, and not affiliated in any way. Partners are not agents of Game Jolt, nor do they have the ability to speak for Game Jolt or contractually bind Game Jolt in any way;

7.7.6. Game Jolt does not monitor any Partner Content, nor does Game Jolt have any responsibility to take action regarding Partner Content or to respond to complaints by you or any other party about Partner Content in any way, whether or not the Partner Content is located on the Game Jolt Marketplace, Game Jolt website or standalone software application, or any other location.

No information or advice given either orally or in writing by Game Jolt or its affiliates will create a warranty or in any way increase the scope of Game Jolt's obligations to you under this agreement.**

Because some states or jurisdictions do not allow the disclaimer of implied warranties, the foregoing disclaimer may not apply to you.

To the maximum extent permissible by law, Game Jolt and its affiliates have no liability to you or any other person for any loss of profits, sales, business, data, or other incidental, consequential, or special loss or damage of any kind.
